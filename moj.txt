Once upon a time, in a land far, far away, there was a programmer who loved to code. 
One day, they encountered a bug that seemed impossible to fix. 
After hours of frustration, they decided to take a break and have a cup of coffee. 
To their surprise, the solution came to them in a flash while sipping their coffee. 
They quickly returned to their computer, implemented the fix, and the code worked perfectly!
